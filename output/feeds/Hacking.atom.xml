how to use Metasploit. I've been familiar with Metasploit for a while 
now, so this isn't really about learning something new so much as it is 
finally getting familiar with a tool that I've messed with only a little
in the past. Part of this is because I have no programming projects to 
occupy myself with since I have a real problem finding an interesting 
problem or project that I can code a solution for. Metasploit is also 
something I feel I should know how to use, if I ever want to run a quick
pentest against my own network, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.metasploit.com"&gt;Metasploit&lt;/a&gt;, to be really simple is a "free" 
suite of penetration testing software.  It gives you a framework full of 
tools needed to scan networks, find their vulnerabilites, exploit them, 
and keep track of what you find. Running it requires all the skill of 
your average skiddie, which is good, because I'm mainly a sysadmin who
dabbles in infosec. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to learn any piece of software is to use it, but with 
something like Metasploit, you kind of need a target network, and you 
don't necessarily want to exploit your own production boxes, and even if
you did, assuming you've "hardened" and patched your services reasonably
well, it will be difficult to get very far with Metasploit knowing very
little about it. Thankfully, the community has provided a solution 
aptly named Metasploitable. &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/"&gt;Metasploitable&lt;/a&gt; 
is a virtual machine image that runs in &lt;a href="http://www.virtualbox.org"&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/a&gt; 
(also "free") which contains a preconfigured Ubuntu Server that is 
intentionally unpatched or has "vulnerablities included". This allows 
you to practice against the target host through multiple vectors to try 
and gain full root access or compromise it some other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you you have a machine to target, now you just need Metasploit, you
of course could just download and install it, but I have found the best
way is to run &lt;a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org"&gt;BackTrack Linux&lt;/a&gt; which 
comes with Metasploit and other tools preinstalled. I personally also 
run this in a virtual box instance, although you could simply run it 
natively off the liveCD or install it on a computer you have available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have Metasploit, and you have a machine to practice using it 
against, now you just need a guide to use it all. Well, MetaSploit is 
pretty well documented by itself, but what was recommended to me is the 
&lt;a href="http://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/"&gt;Metasploit Unleashed&lt;/a&gt; 
course provided by Offensive Security that guides you through the 
various features of MetaSploit and later exercises you can use. The only 
caveat I've found is that many of the Windows examples obviously don't 
work well against Metasploitable, being Linux, although I suppose you 
could spin up an unpatched Windows XP or 2000 instance to mess with as 
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm only partially through a few chapters of the Metasploit Unleashed 
course and have already learned quite a bit. Maybe later I'll share some
of what I've learned that I've found very useful here.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="metasploit"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>Fierce</title><link href="http://digital-shokunin.net/fierce.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-11T21:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Mitchell</name></author><id>tag:digital-shokunin.net,2013-04-11:fierce.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been learning a little bit about security and penetration testing in my spare time. I have some friends who are professionals in the industry and I have an interest in it myself so when they mention a tool I like to take a look at what it does and learn a little bit about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ha.ckers.org/fierce/"&gt;Fierce&lt;/a&gt; is a domain scanning tool, what that means is it scans an organization's domains for listed hosts. For example, a target company may have several non-contigious IP ranges or have branch sites or locations that aren't using the same public IP's as say their website or main office. By scanning their DNS records you might discover some hosts on IP's that weren't in the same scope as say their website or primary data center, and thus may be hosts that aren't as vigilantly maintained. An organization's IT department might have hosts or backdoors to access a branch location they setup for themselves that they setup a domain name for (ex:branch32-jumphost.company.com) that isn't apparent by scanning a single IP address range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By scanning the company's DNS records, you can easily discover the lesser known vectors of attack in theory. Also, it's not as likely to trigger an intrusion detection system like one would if you port scanned an entire company's IP range looking for available hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fierce is a really simple tool to use, anyone who has used a tool like 
nmap will find it straight forward. Installation is simply done by checking out their subversion repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;svn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;co&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//svn.assembla.com/svn/fierce/fierce2/trunk/ fierce2/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's written in Perl, so you should already have that installed on whatever you'll be running it on. From there it's as simple as going into the newly created fierce2 directory and running a scan against your target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fierce&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are more &lt;a href="https://trac.assembla.com/fierce/wiki"&gt;examples on the wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that I've said all that, while querying someone's DNS records is in and of itself harmless, exercise some common sense. Don't be scanning networks or domains you don't yourself own or have permission to be messing with. At the very least, don't do it exposed from your home IP as you can get yourself in trouble, reported to your ISP, or even in trouble with local law enforcement even if you're just being curious and not going any further then seeing what's out there, it still might be enough to get you in hot water depending on your local laws and ISP's policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you might want to know just how much your own domain records give away, and if you administrate your own DNS, you might want to adjust some settings on your DNS servers to prevent too much from being exposed to would-be attackers. After all, why give away more information to the outside world then you absolutely have to. For those cases, this tool is worth having available even if you're not a dediated security professional yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Security"></category><category term="Pen Testing"></category><category term="DNS"></category></entry><entry><title>CarolinaCon 9</title><link href="http://digital-shokunin.net/carolinacon-9.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-03-17T22:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>David Mitchell</name></author><id>tag:digital-shokunin.net,2013-03-17:carolinacon-9.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://carolinacon.org/"&gt;CarolinaCon 9&lt;/a&gt; was this weekend in Raleigh, NC which I attended Saturday. I was also there as a representative of &lt;a href="http://www.lockfale.com"&gt;FALE&lt;/a&gt;
to help host their lock pick village. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were several &lt;a href="http://carolinacon.org/#SpeakerTopics"&gt;talks&lt;/a&gt; given by some of the FALE members, one titled "Terminal Cornucopia" by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evanbooth"&gt;treefort&lt;/a&gt; was on how ineffective TSA security theater is at preventing weapons from making it onto an airplane. There was a demonstration of a club called "Murica" made with items purchased in the terminal behind TSA security checkpoints consisting of a copy of the Declaration of Independence, with a pointy metal souvenir model of the Washington monument protruding from it. I actually missed this one, but saw and held the hefty "Murica" and can honestly say a violent individual could do some serious damage with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="600" alt="Murica!" src="/static/pictures/murica.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were other talks I were able to attend that took place on Saturday. One, given by &lt;a href="https://github.com/jarrick"&gt;Jarrick&lt;/a&gt; on iPhone data reconnaissance by accessing the sqllite database of iPhone data that iTunes creates when it backs up an iOS device. This makes for an easy way to access text messages, or other data on the phone stored by various applications. He even wrote a local web based utility for browsing the data that he made a failed attempt to demo, but the code is out there on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/lockfale"&gt;FALE github&lt;/a&gt;. Also on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/lockfale"&gt;FALE github&lt;/a&gt; is the code for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/melvin2001"&gt;melvin2001&lt;/a&gt;'s AV avoidance and payload delivery that he gave a talk on later that afternoon. His demo consisted of pre-recorded video, so we saw it work. He even wrote a loop. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/j0emccray"&gt;Joe McCray&lt;/a&gt; also gave a talk with a quick tutorial on how to write assembly, I only attended part of it since the rest of my time was divided assisting with the lockpick village FALE was operating across the hall. We taught people the basics of lockpicking, took $20 donations for their choice of a lockpick kit or t-shirt, as well as showed people how to shim handcuffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos of the talks should be up on the &lt;a href="http://carolinacon.org"&gt;CarolinaCon site&lt;/a&gt; in a week or two if you want to view the talks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="security"></category><category term="hacking"></category><category term="lockpicking"></category></entry></feed>
