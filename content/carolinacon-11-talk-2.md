Summary: Talk on defacement pages

My talk from [CarolinaCon](http://carolinacon.org) is [up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ9j57bbpjM).

This is not a professional talk, by any means, it was a humorous one, 
at a hacker con, meant to be somewhat entertaining, delivered late at night. 
Some of the sites displayed contain profanity, etc. I use some profanity 
in the talk as well. People liked it, one person told me it was their favorite 
talk which shocked me. The slides are [here](http://digital-shokunin.net/presentations/defacement-presentation/).
