Summary: Another CarolinaCon, another talk.

I gave another talk for this years CarolinaCon 12 called "Never Go Full Spectrum
Cyber". For this talk I focused on mistakes "hackers" and even some InfoSec
professionals have made and then a short summary at the end of OpSec lessons
that could have prevented the mistakes covered earlier in the talk.

The talk slides are [here](http://digital-shokunin.net/presentations/full-spectrum-cyber/).

I referenced OpSec work and talks done by the grugq. His you can find his site
I mentioned in the end of the talk at [grugq.github.io](https://grugq.github.io/).
The talk I mentioned by the grugq, is called [OPSEC: Because Jail is for wuftpd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XaYdCdwiWU). My talk was initially just
going to be funny stories of hackers getting busted for amazingly feats of stupidity
as kind of my follow up of funny defacement pages that are out there. Then I thought about OpSec lessons interspersed, then while researching OpSec, I found the grugq had more or less done the same kind of talk but focused purely on lulzsec and how they were taken down and less humor (granted his talk is still pretty funny).

Video of my talk should up soon. Just keep an eye on the [CarolinaConVideos YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/CarolinaConVideos) and look for talk by Randy.

Other than my own talk, some other members of FALE and friends of mine gave talks.
Look for the talks by Jim Lahey on a Perimeter monitoring solution he's working on, Jared Haight on [PS>Attack](http://psattack.com/), Solray on his [OS INT tool](http://osintframework.com) and [Chrome extension](https://github.com/lockfale/ARF-chrome), and twinlol on iOS reverse engineering. Check those out
as well as all the other talks.

As for CarolinaCon itself, this year had an epic (for CarolinaCon) turn out. We
almost sold out of the official badge by Friday night (360 total), and they were soon gone
Saturday morning. The official badge was a PCB board/shield for the Arduino Micro
which could be modded/hacked or came with a kit to assemble which would have a
blinking LED where the blink rate was controlled by light exposure to a photo
resistor. I modded mine ahead of time with an Arduino 3.3v 5Mhz Mini Pro and an
OLED screen that displayed that I was a speaker, the FALE logo, and a "sombrero".
I posted a [picture on my twitter feed](https://twitter.com/digitalshokunin/status/706226740595695616) as well as a
[video of the best modded badge by a regular attendee](https://twitter.com/digitalshokunin/status/706226411334451200).
