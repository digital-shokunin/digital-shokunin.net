Summary: Back to Vegas for my second year.

I'm still recovering from Vegas even a week later. So I'm just going to link a
bunch of things you should check out and mention a few cool things that happened
or that I saw.

* [PowerShell Empire](http://www.powershellempire.com/) - written in my two
favorite scripting languages, may replace Meterpreter someday.
* [Modern Honeypot Network](https://threatstream.github.io/mhn/) - build your
 own cloud based network of honeypots that feed results back into a centralized
server.
* [HoneyDrive](https://bruteforce.gr/honeydrive) - an okay honeypot VM image (if
you for some reason want to run your honeypot in VirtualBox or VMWare)


I also put together a DarkNet badge, walked until my knee gave out, attended a
lot of events. DefCon itself was overcrowded, I stayed out of the talks and main
halls and focused on SkyTalks, and the villages and competition areas. The
[DefCon biohacking village](http://www.defconbiohackingvillage.org/) was to me
the most interesting new thing this year.
