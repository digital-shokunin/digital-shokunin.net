Summary: Used Koding's free VM and prototyping environment to experiment with uWSGI and Flask

[Koding][koding] is a cool site that provides a web-based development environment
that is perfect for budding programers and veteran programmers who want an
easy to use sandbox environment to develop in. For free you get a VM that
that comes pre-setup so that you can develop in several languages including 
Python, plus database backends ability to install more resources (you get
full root access to your VM).

A lot of coders use it to stage or live demo a project, and of course the 
VM automatically shutsdown when you log off. You can expand the VM's but
that's the point you start paying, or once your project needs some real 
resources, or you want to bring on additional team members, etc. 

Myself, I've been using it as a convenient place to experiment with writing
Python web applications using uWSGI and the [Flask framework][flask]. I found a 
[tutorial Flask][flask-tutorial], which is apparently done by the same 
person writing the O'Reilly Flask book.
