Summary: Summary of my experiences at BSides LV and DefCon 22

I managed to make it to Vegas in a rather unexpected way, what originally
was a planned beach trip ended up not working out, and I ended up being 
able to join [Fale][fale] at [BSides LV][bsideslv] and [DefCon 22][defcon].

I was working in the mornings, but most of my free time at BSides LV was 
spent at our lockpick village. I didn't get to attend any talks, but the 
talks were [found online][bsides-talks] shortly after, my favorite one 
being the Hack the Gibson talk which focused on IBM mainframes. Very 
educational considering I work with mainframes and do some operations on 
them at work. Jon McAfee, yes, that [McAfee](http://www.mcafee.com) also 
made an appearance, which was interesting to say the least. He talked a 
little about his version of events regarding [his recent troubles in Belize](http://www.wired.com/2012/12/ff-john-mcafees-last-stand/).
Including alleged hired assassins out to get him, his personal [spy ring][(ttp://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/the-bizarre-tale-of-john-mcafee-spymaster/), and people
popping out from behind trees they're hiding behind, and snapping pictures, etc.
Later, he shifted into some Snowden-esque persona rallying for personal
privacy online, and plugged his new product that spys on spyware, not sure
how you protect yourself from spyware by installing his "trusted" spyware,
but that was the sales pitch from my view. Also, there was the 
[tower of vendor distributed condoms, collectively named "Bonerhenge"],[bonerhenge] 
built by some people who apparently don't know what condoms are for in 
Vegas, thus had some time on their hands. Some super sensitive recruiters
who think its fine to repeatedly interrupt a conversation but take it 
personally when you didn't want their ice cream resulting in a some con 
drama associated with the whole of FALE for some reason and FALE's rudeness 
because a member off on his own answered a question honestly (hackers at hackercons tend 
to be brutally honest, but nothing particularly offensive was said other 
than "I don't like recruiters"). That may or may not have resulted in our 
services being no longer required next year, no idea. It did at least 
result in a staff member pointing their finger at me and everyone at the 
table, making a face and while saying something to the effect of "SHAME 
ON YOU FALE, RUDE!" with no apparent explaination, over an hour after the 
'incident' took place. At least we can  attend the talks next year, which 
is the main disadvantage of running a booth. Other than that BSides was a 
blast, and to be honest the whole recruiter-gate thing is a rather humorous 
case of a minor incident beingblown way out of proportion by a vendor who 
doesn't like what hackers say when asked. It would be ironic if that is 
what led to FALE not being asked back next year, considering BSides was 
founded out of BlackHat censorship by vendors. It would not be surprising, 
it would be just another case of "new boss, same as the old boss". I suppose, 
all cons like that vendor money, granted, its not like anyone's talk was 
shutdown. Besides, if you don't get in some kind of trouble, you're probably 
not doing it (Vegas) right.
