Summary:CarolinaCon 2017

Iworked another year as staff for [CarolinaCon](http://www.carolinacon.org) 2017. This year I helped run the hardware hacking village with my friends and fellow members of [FALE](http://www.lockfale.com) which was mostly if not completely used to assemble badges for the conference which where Atmel based hardware badges that communicated wirelessly with RF modules on the ~900+Mhz frequency range. The badges were designed by my friend [melvin2001](https://twitter.com/melvin2001) whom I miss badly now that he's moved across country. The code for the badges are located on the [FALE GitHub](https://github.com/lockfale/CC13).

I'lldidn't see the talks mostly being tucked away on the other end of the conference but most of the talks will be posted on the [CarolinaCon YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdh5UOMgeDvnSkyRb_zIm_2NPMcR_DSsC)
