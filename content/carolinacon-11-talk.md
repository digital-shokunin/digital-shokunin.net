Summary: Talk on defacement pages

I will be attending [CarolinaCon](http://carolinacon.org) again this 
year with [FALE](http://www.lockfale.com) since we are run the LockPick 
Village. The big difference this year will be I am giving a talk as well. 
This will be my first talk at a conference of any kind.

Unless something changes I'm scheduled Friday night(Mar 20th) at 10pm. 
Giving a talk at all was almost unexpected and only came about because 
they had extended the call for papers by a few days when not enough talks 
were recieved. I and several of the FALE membersrallied others and 
submitted our own talks. Mine was completely off the wall and related to
a treasure trove of terrible but funny defacement pages I'd discovered. 
I hope to give an account of defacement pages, a short history of them, 
deconstruct them with hopefully humorous results. I was surprised when 
it was actually excepted, especially since a lot of talks were submitted 
and some rejected.

The [clock is ticking](http://lockfale.com/ohgod/carolinacon.php) and my
talk is coming along so far. Being my first con talk, I keep going 
through mood swings of this talk will be hilarious to doubting myself 
and thinking "this is a terrible idea, what am I even doing" but it 
doesn't last long. I just want people to learn something and get a laugh 
out of it, if I can nail those two things I think I have something.
