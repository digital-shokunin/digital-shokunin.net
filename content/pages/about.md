Summary: About me and Digital Shokunin


<img alt="Communing with squirrels" align=right style="padding:5px;" src='/static/pictures/david.jpg'>This site is focused on my professional and enthusiast experiences with information technology, including coding, hacking, system administration, and anything else I happen to learn or find informative in this area.

Professionally, I am a system administrator. I work with Linux (and some Unixes), some Windows systems, mostly administrating middleware platforms such J2EE Application Servers and message oriented middleware (mostly the IBM WebSphere product line). I've also been working heavily with the Eucalyptus cloud platform. Along with that comes some coding and programming in Java and Python, and some other shell languages such Perl, bash, even PowerShell. I've written in other languages in the past (Pascal, COBOL, C++, even VB .NET), but rarely have the chance or desire to use them.

What I do in my free time (and probably the majority of what this blog will be about) involves a lot of different things. I am involved in a local hacker space run by [FALE](http://www.lockfale.com), which works with a lot of things such as self built 3D printers, micro electronics (Arduino), quad copters/drones, information security, and coding. Loosely related to that I am also into lock picking, and regularly attend [FALE](http://lockfale.com) meetings, as well a local Python User's Group, [PyPTUG](http://www.pyptug.org), and sometimes attend some of the Linux User Group meetings in my area. You might also find me at local tech conferences and InfoSec conferences. I fill the rest (most) of my time playing with my kids, playing Minecraft with my wife, and enjoying life in a small town outside Winston-Salem, NC.

I also have a lot of projects at home involving my various Linux boxes, the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org), an arcade cabinet, this web site, and whatever else I end up working on. I am also a new father, so that will likely cut into my project time, or the nature of the projects will change as my kids becomes older.

Note: a short explaination of the term "digital shokunin", or more to the point, a "shokunin". Shokunin is a Japanese word I learned of while watching a documentary called [Jiro Dreams of Sushi](goo.gl/1fEuk). In it, the master sushi chef Jiro explains the concept of a shokunin. Loosely translated, it means craftsmen or artisan, but it holds more meaning then simply that, it describes someone who dedicates their life to the pursuit of mastery or perfection of their craft. It's a bit more then that but you can watch his explanation. I've always felt driven to learn more
and get better at what I do, whether it be programming, operations, dabbling in infosec, etc.
