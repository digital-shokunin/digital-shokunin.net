Summary: About me and Digital Shokunin


<img alt="Communing with squirrels" align=right style="padding:5px;" src='/static/pictures/david.jpg'>First off, I am David Mitchell, and this is my blog focused on my coding and technical endeavors. I have other blogs and web presences but I wanted a site that focused on my professional and enthusiast experiences with information technology, including coding, hacking, system administration, and anything else I happen to learn or find informative in this area.

Before I get further into who I am I'd first like to explain the concept of digital shokunin, or more to the point, a "shokunin". Shokunin is a Japanese word I learned of while watching a documentary called [Jiro Dreams of Sushi](goo.gl/1fEuk). In it, the master sushi chef Jiro explains the concept of a shokunin. Loosely translated, it means craftsmen or artisan, but it holds more meaning then simply that, it describes someone who dedicates their life to the pursuit of mastery or perfection of their craft. At least they strive to come as close to such a thing as possible, as a shokunin is never satisfied that they ever reach that point and are constantly striving to improve. It describes a philosophy or lifestyle as much as it describes a person. I felt this perfectly described my attitude towards my interests, it has become a lifestyle for me as much as anything and I constantly try to increase my skills, learn new things, or find some area to improve. However, I am no sushi chef or artisan, and my interests aren't constrained to any one area of computing like programming or system administration, I kind of like it all, all things 'digital', hence, digital shokunin.

Professionally, I am a system administrator. I work with Linux (and some Unixes), some Windows systems, mostly administrating middleware platforms such J2EE Application Servers and message oriented middleware (mostly the IBM WebSphere product line). Along with that comes some coding and programming in Java and Python, and some other shell languages such Perl, bash, even PowerShell. I've written in other languages in the past (Pascal, COBOL, C++, even VB .NET), but rarely chance or desire to use them.

What I do in my free time (and probably the majority of what this blog will be about) involves a lot of different things. I am involved in a local hacker space, [FabLocker](http://fablocker.org) which works with a lot of things such as self built 3D printers, working and programming micro electronics (Arduino), quad copters/drones, information security, and coding. Loosely related to that I am also into lock picking, regularly attending [FALE](http://lockfale.com) meetings, as well a local Python User's Group, [PyPTUG](http://www.pyptug.org), and sometimes attend some of the Linux User Group meetings in my area. I also play video games for fun, although less so of late, but have enjoyed games like MineCraft, I own a PS3, and have a plethora of games in my Steam account I probably will never have time to play them all. I also, once owned a 360 also, mostly just because I didn't have time to keep up with games on two consoles. Incidentally, I sold it to a [PowerShell programmer who has written about some things he has learned involving PowerShell and the 360](https://powershellreflections.wordpress.com/category/xbox-360/).

I also have a lot of projects at home involving my various Linux boxes, the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org), an arcade cabinet, this web site, and whatever else I end up working on. I am also a new father, so that will likely cut into my project time, or the nature of the projects will change as my daughter becomes older.
