Summary: Bsides Asheville talks

Quick summary of a few cons I went to. I went to [ISSA conference in Charlotte](https://www.charlotteissa.org/) earlier with FALE, but more recently
I went to [BSides Asheville](http://www.bsidesasheville.com/) as a volunteer.
I also participated in their CTF with some Cha-Ha members, and we came very
close to winning, but placed second. Some friends and I camped out isntead of
staying in a hotel, listened to bluegrass in a mountain bar and saw some talks,
etc.

BSides Asheville took place in a co-op office and was small and intimate. I
enjoyed it as I did any excuse to visit Asheville, NC. I learned more from the
CTF then the talks (more just that I learn better by doing), got to utilize some
skills I'd only gotten to use once or twice to practice or done in training. I
hope to go again next year, especially if I get to go camping.
