Summary: Follow up barcode scanner that automatically populates your grocery list on your phone and other interesting discoveries

[Oscar scanner][oscar] is a project I mentioned in an [earlier post][oscar-post]. 
I wanted to follow up on that with my progress. It's basically working now,
more or less, after some hiccups trying to run it on Arch, and lack of 
time or motivation, ordering wifi adapters, etc. I have a [video][oscar-video]
up demonstrating it's use.
