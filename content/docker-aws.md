Summary: Getting AWS and Puppet certified, AWS and Docker vulnerabilities

The last year I've been busy working quite a bit with AWS. I've gone so far as to get my certification as the Associate Level as an AWS Architect. I accomplished this earlier in the year as well as renewing my Puppet Certification just recently for 2017. I may also be getting Docker certified.

Also related to AWS, I've recently discovered some infosec related resources on AWS from the offensive perspective. The first is [Daniel Grzelak](https://danielgrzelak.com/) who has a blog on some of the possible way someone can back door an AWS account using AWS services. Another is a tookit called [CS Suite](https://github.com/SecurityFTW/cs-suite) which I haven't had a chance to use extensively yet, but can help with auditing AWS security. AWS also provides some tools to do the same.

Related to Docker, [NotSoSecure also released a VM](https://www.notsosecure.com/vulnerable-docker-vm/) that can be used to practice finding security issues in Docker containers.
